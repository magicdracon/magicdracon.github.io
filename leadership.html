            <h2>Leadership opportunities I have had</h2>
            <p>
                I have had the opportunity to lead and contribute to several organizations, where I focused on creating supportive environments that foster growth, teamwork, and community involvement. My key leadership roles include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>President of H.A.C.K.S:</strong> Led the Hurricane Association for Computer Koding and Science for two years, overseeing club projects, organizing tech industry field trips, and growing the club into a thriving tech community.</li>
                <li><strong>Vice President of National Honor Society (NHS):</strong> As NHS Vice President, I played a significant role in organizing community service projects, including *Subs for Santa* and initiatives with the *Dove Center*. My focus was on creating meaningful service opportunities for members and fostering a culture of giving back.</li>
                <li><strong>Math Club Activity Organizer:</strong> Planned and led Math Club activities, promoting problem-solving and collaborative learning. I aimed to make math engaging and accessible for all members through interactive events and competitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech and Debate Team Member:</strong> As a three-year member and varsity letter recipient, I supported team members in practice sessions and contributed to our success at region and state tournaments.
